# CSS-Grid-Project
A small interactive project to show the advantage of CSS Grid Layout using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

In the first tab enter the box number whose position you can change.
In the next tab enter the starting column line and then in next one enter ending column line.
Similarly enter two line values for row as well.
And see how it changes the position of that box to the desired location.
